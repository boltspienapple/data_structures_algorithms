# Stacks and Queues
## Stacks
A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought of as a linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack</br>

    Useful when recent elements are important
    Push - Adding elements to the stack
    Pop  - Removing elements from stack
    Size - Returns the size of stack
    Top  - Returns the top element of stack

    In stack elements can be added and removed from Top Only
    so it is also known as LIFO

    LIFO - Last in First Out 
    since the last element added will be on top of the stack
    so we can remove only that but can't access the element 
    elow it before removing them.

## Queues
Queue is similar to stack but here the **element added first is removed first**</br>

    Head    - The first element or the oldest element added
    Tail    - The last element addes
    Enqueue - Add element to the tail of the queue
    Dequeue - Remove an element from the front of the queue
    Deque   - That goes both the ways adding and removing
    Priority Queue - A numerical priority is inserted.
