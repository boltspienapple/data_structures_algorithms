# Arrays 
## Collections
A group of things</br>
Example</br>

    Group of friends
    places to tracel in bucket list
Order is not required</br>
There may be different type of objects in Collections</br>

## Lists
Similar to Collection but they have Order</br>
No fixed Length</br>

## Arrays
**Collection of variables of Same Data Types**</br>


    Has indices
    Index Starts at 0
    First index - 0
    Have fixed length
    Stored in a memory
    Adding and removing elements is hard

*Have different conditons according to different programming languages*


    Example
    [a, b, c, d, e] the array list can be accessed using indices
    [0] - a
    [1] - b
    [2] - c
    [3] - d
    [4] - e
**Exception**</br>
    
    In Python lists acts as arrays
## Linked Lists
    Stores reference to the next value instead of indices
    Adding and Removing elements is easy unlike the arrays
## Doubly Linked Lists
    It has refernce to the next element and also the previous element
    Can tranverse the list in both directions
