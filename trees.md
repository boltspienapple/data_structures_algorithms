# Trees
A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.</br>
**Conditions to be a tree**</br>

    Must be connected
    Must not be a cycle. If its cycle then its not a tree
*First element is called as Root*</br>

    Node : Individual element in a tree
    Nodes are described with Parent Child Relationship
    Parent : The node at a lower level is called Parent
    Child : The node connected to a higher level is called Child
    A node in the middle can be a parent or child depends on what it is connected to.

    Internal Node: Parent node is also called as Internal Node
    Height of a Node : Number of edges between it and the furthest leaf on the tree
    Leaf has height ZERO
    Height of the tree : It is just height of the Root Node
    Depth of the node : Number of edges to the root

    Height and Depth are inversely proportional in relation

**Each Node can only have 1 parent but a parent can have any number of children**</br>
**Exception : Root node has no parent**
