#  Way of Solving Problems
## First thing to solve a problem is:
    Make sure to understand a problem 
    Understand what are the inputs and how they are represented
    Understand what is the desired output
    Find the relation between Inputs and Outputs
    
    
    Solution:
    Inputs ------>  Process  ------> Outputs
    return(ing) number is better than printing it so can be used in multiple purposes in computation, if printed hard to use for anything else

### Why to understand Problem
    1. It helps in creating a logic for the code
    2. For choosing a better algorithm
    3. For writing a clean slate code
    4. It helps us to minimize mistakes while writing code

#### Pythonista's Guide to solve Problem
    0. Don't Panic!!!
    1. What are the Inputs?
    2. What are the Outputs?
    3. Consider SYSTEMATICALLY how a human solves this problem 
        1. Try to write a Pseudo-Code
        2. Think wheter it satisfies all conditions
        3. If it doesn't satisfy write them 
        4. Try to edit the Pseudo-Code and satisfy all the conditions
    4. Think about the algorithm that best suits to solve the problem
    5. Solve the Problem
    6. Don't optimize Prematurely
