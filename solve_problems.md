#  Way of Solving Problems
## First thing to solve a problem is:
    Make sure to understand a problem 
    Understand what are the inputs and how they are represented
    Understand what is the desired output
    Find the relation between Inputs and Outputs
    
    
    Solution:
    Inputs ------>  Process  ------> Outputs
    return(ing) number is better than printing it so can be used in multiple purposes in computation, if printed hard to use for anything else

### Why to understand Problem
    1. It helps in creating a logic for the code
    2. For choosing a better algorithm
    3. For writing a clean slate code
    4. It helps us to minimize mistakes while writing code
